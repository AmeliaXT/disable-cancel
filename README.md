# Disable Cancel

This plugin allows you to disable the cancel behaviour of actions which require a source and target, such as using items of casting spells.
In the event of no target, whether in the game world or interface, the action will not be cancelled until a target is clicked.

No longer do you need to re-select an item or spell when you accidentally click the ground next to what you actually meant to click!
